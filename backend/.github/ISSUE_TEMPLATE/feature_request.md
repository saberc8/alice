## Technical Considerations

### Architecture Impact

How would this feature fit into the current DDD architecture?

- **Domain Layer**: [Impact on domain entities, services, repositories]
- **Application Layer**: [Impact on application services, use cases]
- **API Layer**: [New endpoints, request/response models]
- **Infrastructure Layer**: [Database changes, external integrations]

### API Design

If this feature requires new API endpoints, describe them:

```http
POST /api/v1/example
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "field1": "value1",
  "field2": "value2"
}
```

Response:
```http
200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id": 123,
  "field1": "value1",
  "created_at": "2023-12-01T10:00:00Z"
}
```

### Database Schema Changes

If this feature requires database changes, describe them:

```sql
CREATE TABLE example_table (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```
